Bias and variance are defined in 3 different ways, viz Conceptually, Graphically and Mathematically !

Conceptual Defn: 
Error due to bias is taken as  the difference between the expected (or average ??) prediction of our model and the correct value, that we are trying to predict . Expected value means that we are talking of many analysis, creating differenct models of different sets of models.
